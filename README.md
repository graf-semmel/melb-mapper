## Technical Details

Built using:

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for interactive maps
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for frontend tooling (dev server, build)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management
- [BiomeJS](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting
- Geographical data sourced from OpenStreetMap via Overpass API

## Development

The project uses a modular architecture with the following key files in the `src/` directory:

- `app.js` - Manages UI elements, event handling, and transitions between application views (hero, game, search).
- `game.js` - Contains the core game logic, including round management, scoring, timing, and state tracking.
- `geo.js` - Handles fetching and processing of geographical data (suburbs, boundaries) for different cities.
- `main.js` - Acts as the main application entry point, initializes the map and game, loads city data, and orchestrates interactions between different modules.
- `map.js` - Manages Leaflet map creation, configuration, styling, feature layers, and user interactions (zoom, pan, click, hover).
- `style.css` - Provides all CSS styles, variables, layout rules, and animations for the application interface.
- `utils.js` - Contains miscellaneous utility functions used across the application.

The main user interface is defined in `index.html` in the root directory.
